This is when unwanted informations or excess information is given to the consumers
such as credit card details, overly verbose error messages.

Preventions: Make sure every developer knows what is sensitive what is not.
             Use generic error messages as much as you can, don't use custom messages.
             Audit any code for potential information disclosure as part of your QA or 
             build processes. (automate this in the pipeline)
             Make sure your third-party softwares versions are latest and 
             don't have any known vulnerabilities.

Exploits: Get the versions of third-party frameworks/softwares being used through
          Error messages or otherwise and figure out if it has some vulnerabilities in it..

          Maybe the older versions have some vulnerabilities.
