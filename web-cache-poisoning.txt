What is the difference between web cache poisoning and web cache deception?

In web cache poisoning, the attacker causes the application to store some malicious content in the cache, and this content is served from the cache to other application users.

In web cache deception, the attacker causes the application to store some sensitive content belonging to another user in the cache, and the attacker then retrieves this content from the cache.



Steps:

1. Identify all the non-keyed componenet of the request

Sometimes even if the cache-control flags are not set to caching then also the CDN (WAF) might cache the response. So, identify unkeyed params and exploit the request.

In anycase, sometimes the server might ask the Caching service to cache the response by adding this header: Cache-Control: public

We can use headers like X-Forwared-Scheme: http to cache the 301 redirect response and therefore making it a dos (https://hackerone.com/reports/1181946)

x-forwarded-scheme is a non-keyed parameter therefore it can help us get vulnerability reponse cached --> Cache poisoning

Sometimes if the service is behind CDN or WAF, adding X-Forwared-Scheme can result into 301 redirect and also the response will be cached

Downstream Caching:
There is Property Configuration in Akamai where you specify caching rules: the Akamai Edge server is also reponsible for the caching Configuration on the browser (client), it only
allows the cache of an object to be less than the TTL in the Edge server (or less any time lesser than it if supplied by the server in cache-control or expires).

This is How Akamai decide what to cache and what to not cache:

I don't think Twitter is paying enough attention to non product things these days so let's try to attack twitter and find only cache vulnerabilities.

Presentation:

- What is Cache in CDN:

Good article: https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/cdn-caching/ 
Cover what is cdn, how it works, what kind of response it caches, what headers are used in this, finally what is keyed and unkeyed

How can you write cache rules in Akamai and CF. Is it api based or path (regex) based. What is written in it.

Cachable content has something like: Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
ETag: "hash-of-content"
Vary: Accept-Encoding

Uncacheble content should be like: Cache-Control: no-store, private
Pragma: no-cache

Took what is cdn from this article: https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/
    Reverse proxy and CDN, so all requests first goto Cloudlfare for example and it checks cache hit or miss, in case of miss it relays the request to original server.
