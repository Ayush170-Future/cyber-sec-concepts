Blind SQL Injection: Attacher has no evident idea that his attack suceeded or not.
- ' AND sleep(5); --'; => slow response => Tells the attacker that the vulnerability exist => executes other attacks

Preventions:
Goal: How can we treat the data as data not SQL statements?

Solutions:
SQL Sanitizations: Render the input and Place \ before ' before adding the input to the query - there are famous libraries to do this,
SQL Prepared statements: have the placeholder for the input inside the SQL query,
Allowed list for the inputs

Note:
Prepared statements: SQL queries has placeholders and these placeholders are attached with the data provided by the user.
                     so now the data is treated differently, no confused with the SQL query.
