Description:
By file path traversal I can get access to files on the server machine (unix or not)

Exploit that got me the access:
https://0ae0000004e251158151436d00a0005a.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=../../../etc/passwd


Fuzzing with different encoded file paths to check if any works or not.



Same preventions as the SQL injection ones:
 - Sanitize the inputs
 - Treat the input as Data, do not directly concatinate it with the
   file path.
 - Canonicalize the path first and then check if it starts with the base dir or not.
    Java code:
    File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);
    if (file.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)) {
        // process file
    }
