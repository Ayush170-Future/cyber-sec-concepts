Browser Context: 
1) A browsing context is an environment in which a browser displays a Document. 
In modern browsers, it usually is a tab, but can be a window or even only parts of a page, like a frame or an iframe.

2) Each browsing context has an origin (that of the active document) and an ordered history of previously displayed documents.

3) Communication between browsing contexts is severely constrained. Between browsing contexts of the same origin, a BroadcastChannel can be opened and used.

IFrame:
Basically a smaller Browser context into a bigger one, embedded another HTML page into the current one.
- Each Iframe has its own origin therefore, SoP applies here as well.

The topmost browser context is known as browser window represented by Window object
